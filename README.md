# Image acquisition

A field study was carried out at the Fazenda Campanário feedlot in Laguna Carapã, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil (22°47'8" S; 55°3'57" W), which houses approximately 14,600 cattle. Data acquisition was performed using a multirotor UAV (DJI Phantom 4 Advanced) equipped with a 20-megapixel Sony camera (4864 × 3648 pixels). All flights were conducted at a fixed altitude of 15m to maintain consistent spatial resolution. Twelve flight operations were carried out at approximately 10-day intervals. Image acquisition was performed using a 90 degree camera angle, with a 50\% overlap between consecutive images. Data collection was conducted in the morning, between 7:00 and 11:00 a.m., under varying weather conditions, including cloudy, sunny and rainy scenarios. The acquisition platform operated at a speed of 4 m/s. Monitoring was performed over a 112-day period, starting on July 10, 2024. The average age of the cattle at the beginning of the feedlot period was 18 months.
